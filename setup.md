### Obtain lesson materials

1. Download [python-novice-inflammation-data.zip][zipfile1]
        and [python-novice-inflammation-code.zip][zipfile2].
2. Create a folder called `python-intro` in your `DATASCHOOL` folder.
3. Move downloaded files into this newly created folder.
4. Unzip the files.

You should now see two new folders called `data` and `code` in your `python-intro` directory on your
Desktop.
